I tried rotating photo but couldnt get it to translate on the website.
Ive already installed Vs code to this computer allowing for this process to be alot simpler. With VS code having bash already installed on mac this was also bypassed for me. Overall this step was bypassed or passed becuase ive already done these steps eaelier in the year.

To remotely connect to a server we needed to find your ucsd username from the alloted wesbtie URL. Therfore allowing acess to these remote systems where each of us was allowed to enter and control a server that was distant from us. This was useed using the ieng6 platform to cange our passwords and allow us to control it. Then we were shown the cpu percentage we were using and the host names with averages.

After achieving access to these remote servers, I was able to change directories and go through resouces or files that were prsent in these rmeote servers I havent seen before. This allowed for the process of allowing me to see what fies were included and which directories were remotely acessed. Overall, this gave us a sense of why controlling a server from a distant area would be like and the tools we need to use.
