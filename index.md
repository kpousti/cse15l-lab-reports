# STEP 1
Once you figure out what operating system you are working on, then it is time to install.
Ive already installed Vs code to this computer allowing for this process to be alot simpler. With VS code having bash already installed on mac this was also bypassed for me. Overall this step was bypassed or passed becuase Ive already done these steps earlier in the year.From here you can install visual studio code and figure out which preferneces are the best for you.

To install vs code no matter if mac or windows visit this website; https://code.visualstudio.com
Once installed follow the given steps shown to install and add onto the application folder on your device.

To remotely connect to a server we needed to find your username from the alloted wesbtie URL. Therfore allowing acess to these remote systems where each of us was allowed to enter and control a server that was distant from us. This was used using the ieng6 platform to change our passwords and allow us to control it. Then we were shown the cpu percentage we were using and the host names with averages.

After achieving access to these remote servers, I was able to change directories and go through resources or files that were present in these remote servers I havent seen before. This showed for the process of allowing me to see what files were included and which directories were remotely acessed. Overall, this gave us a sense of why controlling a server from a distant area would be like and the tools we need to use.



# *Key Commands Used*
*cat- used to print the contents of one or more files given by the path.
*ls- List used to list the files and folders the given path.
*pwd-used to display the current working directory.
*cd-used to switch the current working directly to the given path.

When used these commands can change directories and find files for the user.

Errors such as directory not found or file not found error. Both will show you what you need to do to get to the file you are looking for.
